## v0.1.1
- Added a `w_readline` so `libreadline` is no longer a hard requirement. It is still recommended, however. (turn on the define `-DHAS_READLINE` in order to activate it. This is done by default on Windows).
- Fixed compilation errors that for some reason I didn't get on my computer.
## (dev)
- Fixed `(null):1:1` file position appearing in certain circumstances.
