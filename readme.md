# wi - Tungstyn Interpreter
This is the repository for `wi`, the interpreter for the Tungstyn language. The language design and the interpreter are both currently very much a work-in-progress, and as such you will find bugs. Please report these as github issues. If you have any suggestions, I would also appreciate if you made them github issues too.
Documentation on the language (in markdown format) is available under the docs/ directory.
## A note on naming
The chemical symbol for tungsten (the element that is the language's namesake) is `W`. This is noticable in the file extension used for tungstyn (`.w`) and the name of this interpreter (`wi`, Tungstyn Interpreter).
